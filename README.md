# Javascript - API Consumption

This is my API consumption project and i'm returning what we did in Santiago's workshop.  
I feel like I learned alot from his workshop, I followed his instructions and did the assignments.
However, I was a day behind on the lectures due to work so I missed one lecture witch they forgot to record.

## What is an API and how does it work?

API or "Application Programming Interface" is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other or a gateway that allows software to talk to another software.  
For example, if you are booking a flight through an 3rd party website(kiwi.com), that website is getting their flight information from the airline's API.

## What is JSON?

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It is often used when data is sent from a server to a web-page. JSON is self-describing and easy to understand.
